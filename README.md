1. Java
2. Maven
3. Chrome

## How to run tests
1. Using IntelliJ IDEA
    * Go to Maven Profiles
    * Select `chrome`, `headless-chrome`, `firefox`, `headless-firefox`, `edge`, `ie` or `safari` Maven Profile as the browser
    * Select `dev`, `qa`, `uat`, `pre-prod` or `prod` Maven Profile as the environment
    * Select the test classes on the `src/test/java` folder
    * Right-click and click on `Run`


2. Using Command Line
    * To run the smoke test suite in Firefox browser against the QA environment

      `mvn clean test -Pfirefox,qa,smoke-test`
    * To run the regression test suite in Safari browser against the UAT environment
